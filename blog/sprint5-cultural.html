                    <h1>Reflection - Foundations Core Skills</h1>
                        <h3>Three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reflection</li>
                                    <p>
                                        I found it difficult, at first, to reflect on challenges where I got stuck. Having previously come from a 
                                        computer science background, I held myself up to a certain standard only to realise I was holding myself 
                                        down from growth. I’ve learned that to overcome obstacles and have genuine reflections, I had to put my 
                                        ego aside. Bringing down your wall of stubbornness will open your mind up to growth and opportunities that 
                                        will lead to your success.
                                    </p>
                                <li>Inevitable Insecurities</li>
                                    <p>
                                        The slack DevAcademy group chat is where we can share our recent blogs and apps. But there is a couple 
                                        of pros and cons to having this platform; one con being the inevitable need to compare your work with others. 
                                        It was inevitable to see my peers as competition at first and it is fair to see it this way as we’re all here 
                                        to reach the same goal, more or less. But all this was going on in my head so I took a step back and reassess. 
                                        I decided to look at the positive side, one major positive being how we can give and receive feedback for improvement.
                                    </p>
                                <li>Asking for help</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Initially, my ego got in the way of asking help from strangers. I didn’t know anyone in the cohort 
                                        and have only interacted with a couple of staff members. When googling for answers just wouldn’t seem to 
                                        work, I had to finally set my ego aside and ask questions. The people in the academy are great and 
                                        is what made the whole Foundation process easier. I casually chime in on ideas and help out where I 
                                        can now. It was basically just the start that I needed to get over
                                    </p>
                            </ul>
                            
                        <h3>Roles of VALUES, EMPATHY and SELF AWARENESS in learning and programming</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Values</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Values are what a person strong believes in and will stand for. One common value that is applicable 
                                        to everything is being true to your word. Commit and deliver to what you have promised because to 
                                        display trustworthiness does not only show leadership skills but also shows that you are a person 
                                        of value. 
                                    </p>
                                <li>Empathy</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Most employers, not just in the tech industry, prefer to hire a team player willing to be trained 
                                        in the process over an arrogant lone-wolf who has the perfect technical skills on paper; empathy 
                                        is an important trait of a leader. Ironically, a leader is the one who stays back with the slowest 
                                        in the pack and nurtures them forward.
                                    </p>
                                <li>Self Awareness</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Reflection is key to further and continuous development and you can’t do this without any sense of 
                                        self awareness. In order for one to reflect on ones self, you must have have the awareness of your 
                                        actions and be accepting of your flaws. Turn your weakness into strength by focusing on honing your 
                                        skills one flaw at a time.
                                    </p>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>Most surpring thing about core learning</h3>
                            <p>I didn’t expect to learn so much about Neuroplasticity. This part of the core was what I was interested in 
                                the most. Knowing the idea and its principles will help us unlock unimaginable abilities and overcome 
                                impossible obstacles simply by changing our way of thinking and doing. Along with Growth Mindset and my 
                                drive to become successful, I truly believe that, Neuroplasticity is the key to success and I’m glad 
                                DevAcademy had introduced us to it.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Most challenging aspects of core learning</h3>
                            <p>The most challenging aspect of the core learning for me was identifying my values, strengths and weaknesses 
                                as part of my identity and how I see it relating to my learning and career development. Although I did 
                                previously mentioned that I talking about myself isn’t exactly the hardest thing in the world, I still did 
                                feel a bit of exposure writing about the values as a persona and the culture that I grew up around that has 
                                made me into the person I am now.</p>

                        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                            <p>I believe the reason why DevAcademy is so focused on honing everyone’s core skills is what separates them 
                                from other institutions. It is the need for employability in all aspects of the applicant. The academy not 
                                only research what technology is used by companies for us be trained on but also what type of people these 
                                successful companies hire and look for. It’s about learning how to fit in the team as a programmer and as 
                                a social creatures. This is the academy’s unique competitive advantage.</p>

                        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</h3>
                            <p>I’ve done my due diligence on DevAcademy before deciding to join. I could’ve joined any other tertiary 
                                establishments to reach the same goal but it was the academy’s core teachings that really resonated with 
                                what I needed to be employed as a full fledged developer. I need to make sure that the technical skills 
                                are in tandem with my soft skills therefore I don’t believe I’ve wasted my time learning everything the 
                                academy has to offer.</p>
