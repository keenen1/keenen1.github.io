                                    <div class="problem-solving">
                                        <p>
                                            I found the Kata: Super FizzBuzz challenge really fun and engaging. Although there was a moment where it became challenging to me and that was figuring 
                                            out how to get the multiples of an integer. This was exciting as there was mathematics involved. I made use of <span>PSEUDOCODE</span>; writing instructions to guide 
                                            me prior to writing the code to keep me on track. I found this very handy at times when I get lost or carried away. This technique was enough for me to 
                                            get over the obstacle. I knew that I had to use the “%” remainder operator but I had factors in mind instead of multiples. The Pseudocode helped me in 
                                            this as I constantly looked back at the instructions and it was then when it clicked to me that if I check if the number divided by 15 is equals to 0, 
                                            that would be enough to confirm that it’s a multiples of 15. This particular problem made me feel excited and engaged throughout. Despite the roadblock, 
                                            I was very keen to get over my confusion and not let it get the best of me since I knew I was very capable of solving the problem. My takeaway from this 
                                            is to always refer back and understand what is being asked, especially when you get blocked because it may simply just be a small misconception in the end.

                                <h3>Solved a Problem in an Elegant Way</h3>

                                            I found the Kata: Built-in Method an extremely difficult roadblock to get around from since it mainly consisted of anonymous arrow functions. 
                                            This was something we had to learn ourselves as it wasn’t covered as a lesson in the course, so far. I first tried <span>GOOGLING</span> basics of 
                                            turning simple functions to arrow functions which was simple enough. Where it got tricky was learning how to turn an anonymous function into 
                                            an anonymous arrow function. I then proceeded to <span>ASKING MY COACH</span> FOR HELP to better understand how to apply this to the problem at hand. I 
                                            found this very helpful and I was very appreciative of the help I was given. However, I wanted to <span>TRY THIS OUT</span> for myself in repetition so I 
                                            can hone my skills on this particular matter even further than learning it theoretically. I started out feeling frustrated being stuck on this problem 
                                            but I wasn’t going to give up so I tried the problem solving techniques mentioned and that alleviated some of the stress as I was finally able to solve 
                                            the problem. But I wanted to extend this learning and put more practice into arrow functions so I tried on a couple of functions form previous Kata’s 
                                            and it honestly made me feel like I was really starting to understand the whole essence of it. My biggest takeaway from this is once you’ve learned the 
                                            solution to your problem, take it further by applying the solution to similar problems to become familiar with it and make it almost second nature to you.

                            In computer science, pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer 
                            program or other algorithm. It uses the structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended 
                            for human reading rather than machine reading and therefore uses plain English language. I’ve made use of this 
                            multiple times and intend to keep doing so whenever I see fit. I’ve also learned to only write Pseudocode for 
                            complex code to avoid unnecessary clutter when the code is, otherwise, straightforward.

                            We all need help sometimes. However, people often disregard this idea when faced with a problem for various reasons: 
                            they might be shy to ask, they may believe that asking would damage their ego, and many others. The fact is, asking 
                            questions won’t only lead you closer to the answers you desire but also build camaraderie and trust between the parties. 
                            Others won’t view any less of you but instead understand that you’re willing to learn which is an attractive trait. 
                            Framing your questions is also very important and usually makes the difference from a good and bad question. Make sure 
                            to always give context and background to bring the person helping up to speed with what it is you’re trying to do. I’ve 
                            used this method many times and usually is the one that leads me to answers half of the time.

                            Both methods can be seen displayed on the terminal when running your code. This is a good practice to not only make 
                            sure your code is running, but it you can display whatever it is you’re returning by the use of Console.Log() and to 
                            be given the appropriate description when you run into a particular error by the throwing Error Messages. I’ve made 
                            use of console.log() at times when I need to check what my complex code is returning for good measure. I’ve also read 
                            error messages provided in the Kata challenges. These save you a lot of time and scrolling to figure out what it is

                            are from your ultimate goal means you've got room for improvement. You then must reflect on your current approach and 
                            underline what could be improved, what needs more attention and what needs less. Every improvement you make is already 
                            an upgrade of yourself. Then you repeat. I have made use of this skill and technique not just in development but also 
                            in life. I give this a Confidence Level 3 because there's always room for improvement.

                            More often than not, trying something will lead to failure. But what if it doesn’t? You won’t know if your idea works 
                            unless you try. A wise man once said, “You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take”. So don’t be afraid to try it 
                            out! Note that you can still try a different approach even when your code works already. Simply comment out the working 
                            code and try whatever it is you had in mind. I sure did! There were many times I would refactor a code because I think 
                            it could be written better. However, I’m still yet to find my own go-to platform to try out new methods, code, functions 
                            and statements. For now, W3Schools does the job.

                            In software engineering, the rubber duck is a method for debugging code. If you’re stuck on a problem, try explaining what 
                            needs to be done to something as dull as an inanimate rubber duck. By assuming its ignorance, you’re having to explain more 
                            thoroughly and exactly than you were likely thinking those specific lines of code through in your head. You’re forced, by 
                            the need to be precise while helping someone else understand your problem, to pay very careful attention to all that you 
                            were previously just taking for granted. Personally, I may have unknowingly used this method before but this is the first 
                            time I’m hearing about it. The method seems useful and effective, I plan on using this more in the future.
