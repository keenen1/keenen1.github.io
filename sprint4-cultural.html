                    <h1>NEUROPLASTICITY</h1>
                        <h3>Understanding Neuroplasticity</h3>
                            <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to re-organize and re-wire itself to learn, adapt and expand. This is done by forming new neural connections and can be done throughout life no matter the age. You may not be able to teach an old dogs new tricks, but you can teach an old brain anything and sky’s the limit!</p>
                        <h3>Benefits to the people in general and to me specifically</h3>
                            <p>Neuroplasticity holds a lot of benefits to a person’s development and way of life. This is often activated when people cope with disadvantaged circumstances by learning new ways to go about normal habits and ultimately conquer obstacles. For athletes, this can occur in the brain to compensate for injury and adjust their activities in response to new situations or changes in their environment until full recovery.</p>
                            <p>For myself personally, I will be particularly engaging with the following principles for my own learning growth: “Repetition Matters” is a principle that I believe will help perfect my craft as a developer. “Use it and Improve it” for continuous improvement; never stop learning to keep up with the pace that technology is growing at. “Interference” will enable me to be open to new ideas and methods that are typically against the flow of what I’m originally comfortable with. It’s about being flexible to welcome change for the better.</p>
                        <h3>Ways to Increase Neuroplasticity</h3>
                            <p>Here are some ways to increase and harness the power of Neuroplasticity</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. Quality Sleep - The brain needs sleep to reset brain connections that are important for memory and learning.</li>
                                <li>2. Continuous Learning - this is almost similar to the principle, "Use it or Lose it".</li>
                                <li>3. Reduce Stress - Take breaks and make sure to exercise. You perform and learn best when your mind is clear.</li>
                                <li>4. Find a strong purpose - Make sure to have a purpose to back you learning journey. This will save you when you feel like giving up.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <h1>GROWTH MINDSET</h1>
                        <h3>What it is and its Relevance</h3>
                            <p>Growth Mindset is the belief that you are in control of your own destiny and no external factors or societal standards can stop you. Having a growth mindset opens your mind to further learning and improvement; no matter your status, age or any point in life. If you’re studying at DevAcademy, you’ll notice that everyone comes together from different stages in life with one goal in mind - to become a web developer.</p>
                        <h3>Research Surprises</h3>
                            <p>I found it very interesting how Growth Mindset can be compared to the Tortoise and the Hare story. The idea that people are born with unique genetic structures, meaning that they can initially be better than others at different things can be overcome with Growth Mindset if you happen to draw the short straw. If you don't persevere and believe in yourself, you will overcome the disadvantaged fate and societal expectations. In the end, become the one to pass on the good persevering gene.</p>
                        <h3>Growth Mindset in my Learning Journey</h3>
                            <p>No mountain too high and no ocean too deep is the mindset I've gone in with when I decided to join DevAcademy. I've set a goal to achieve and found a purpose to keep me going. As a Computer Science graduate, growth mindset is evident as I'm open to re-learning everything to become a full fledged developer.</p>
